Agriculture Data Analytics Project
Overview
Analyzed agricultural data across Indian states and districts to uncover trends in crop production, yield, and area cultivated. The project involves data cleaning, EDA, SQL analysis, and Power BI visualization.

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Plotly): Data cleaning & EDA

PostgreSQL: SQL querying

Power BI: Visual dashboards

Key Tasks
1. Cleaned and standardized area, production, and yield units
2. Removed/handled negative & missing values
3. Performed EDA with Plotly
4. Wrote SQL queries to extract insights
5. Visualized results in Power BI with filters, charts, and slicers

Insights Extracted
Year-wise rice production trend (Top 3 states)

Wheat yield growth by district (last 5 years)

Oilseed production growth rate (state-wise)

Area vs. Production correlation

Cotton trends in top 5 states

Highest yielding districts for rice & wheat

10-year production comparison (Rice vs. Wheat)

Challenges & Solutions
Inconsistent Units: Converted to standard units (tons, ha)

Missing/Negative Values: Filled or recalculated using formulas

SQL ROUND Errors: Fixed with type casting

Power BI Data Mapping: Ensured proper formatting and relationships

Final Output
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard powered by PostgreSQL and insights-driven SQL queries.
